# Raspberry Pi Pico HID

The Pico HID is a part of DIY PiKVM V1 platform and performs keyboard and mouse emulation.
It has excellent compatibility, and by default emulates USB, including two mouse modes: absolute and relative.

The scope of the Pico HID is not limited to V1 platform, it can also be used with V2 and even V3 platform
if you need to emulate a PS/2 keyboard and mouse or use [legacy multiport KVM switch](https://github.com/pikvm/pikvm/issues/7)
which does not fully support USB standards.

This page explains how to build, connect and use all the features of the Pico HID.

## Making the Pico HID

If you are building the PiKVM V1, then all the necessary components should already be at your fingertips.
If you are making the Pico HID for V2 or V3, then here is what you will need:

* Raspberry Pi Pico board with soldered pins. [An official green board (Pico H/WH)](https://pico.pinout.xyz) is recommended.
* *1x* USB type A to Micro-B cable.
* *10x* dupont female-female wires.
* Optional: *1x* 1N5819 diode. But anything similar one will do.

!!! tip "Tip for soldering guru"
    If you know how to solder, you can buy the Pico without pins and no dupond wires, and just solder everything.

!!! warning
    The diode is needed to provide the power to the Pico HID regardless of the host state,
    and prevents backpowering problem. It will allow you to keep the keyboard buttons pressed
    during the host power cycle, which is important for MacOS to get into the boot menus, for example.

    Do not connect the red wire (the `VSYS (Pico) -> 5V (Pi)` line) without a diode.
    If you can't find the diode, don't connect this wire at all.

Connect all the parts according to the scheme:

## Configuring the HID modes

By default, Pico HID emulates a USB keyboard and an absolute or relative mouse
(read [here](mouse.md) about the difference between mouse modes).
For most cases, nothing needs to be changed here. However, if you need something special
(like Windows 98 support), you can do it without reflashing over the current firmware.

To achieve this, the Pico HID uses a runtime configuration, which is set by connecting
some GPIOs with Ground (`GND`) lines.

| Pin name | Description (when connected to GND) |
|----------|-------------|
| `GP2`    | Enable PS/2 keyboard & mouse support (see below). |
| `GP3`    | Prefer the PS/2 keyboard over USB when turning on the HID (if PS/2 enabled). |
| `GP4`    | Prefer the PS/2 mouse over USB (if PS/2 enabled) |
| `GP6`    | Disable USB keyboard & mouse support. This is useful if you only want to use PS/2. |
| `GP7`    | Enable the special USB absolute mouse for Windows 98. |
| `GP8`    | Prefer the relative USB mouse over the absolute one. |
| `GP9`    | Prefer the Windows 98 USB absolute mouse over the regular absolute one (if enabled). |

!!! example
    Connecting pin `GP9` to any `GND` [on the Pico](https://pico.pinout.xyz) enables Windows 98 absolute mouse support.

!!! warning
    At this time, PS/2 is not yet implemented. Soon (r) (c) (tm)

## Flashing the firmware

To upload the firmware to Pico HID, you can use any computer with a USB port.

1. [Download](https://github.com/pikvm/kvmd/releases) the latest release of the firmware. The file is called `pico-hid.uf2`.
2. Press and hold down the white button (BOOTSEL) on the Pico board and plug it using USB cable to the computer.
3. Release the button.
4. The Pico board will appear as a flash drive on the host computer.
5. Copy the `pico-hid.uf2` file to this flash drive root partition.
6. Safely disconnect the USB device.


-----
## The final steps

Connect the Pico HID to the host computer using the USB cable.

If you are building PiKVM V1, then no further action with the Pico HID is required.

If you are making the Pico HID for V2 or V3, add the following lines to the PiKVM configuration and reboot it.

!!! note "KVMD >= 3.241 is required for the Pico HID's complete functionalities"

* `/boot/config.txt`
    ```ini
    dtoverlay=spi0-1cs
    ```

* `/etc/kvmd/override.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    kvmd:
        hid:
            type: spi
            chip: 0
            bus: 0
            sw_cs_pin: 7
            sw_cs_per_byte: true
            reset_pin: 25
            reset_inverted: true
            reset_self: true
            power_detect_pin: 16
            power_detect_pull_down: true
    ```
